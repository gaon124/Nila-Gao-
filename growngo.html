Through this 10 week project, the Grow ‘N’ Go team designed and simulated an automated plant growing system that is capable of functioning while being mounted to a ceiling. This grow box encompasses the basic necessities needed to germinate and nurture a plant, such as automated water circulation and drainage system and artificial lighting. The Grow ‘N’ Go was designed so plants can be grown indoors at any time and place even with time and space restrictions. 
<br>
<br>
  The design of this system was broken down into seven subsystems including: the grow box, the irrigation system, the drainage system, the mechanical raising and lowering mechanism, the automated raising and lowering mechanism, the user interface, and the support.

                    <p>The final product was composed of a strong structure that has the ability to effectively handle an apparatus of up to 40lb in weight. The structure includes a water pump that provides an automated drip irrigation system, operating on a minimum flow rate of 1 gallon per hour. This will be  powered and run by a moisture sensor. The pump also connects to the drainage system, which is capable of holding up to 10 liters of wastewater and recycles the water back to the pump. Additionally, the structure will be mounted to the ceiling and aligned on ceiling rafters and brought to an accessible height using a motorized raising and lowering system controlled by a push button.

  <h3 class="ggallhead1">Customer Research</h3>
  <div class="ggresearch">
    <p>
      Our first steps include user study and ideation. Our goals were to generate a list of customer requirements and survey users their considerations in plant growth. We then utilize these goals to generate concepts using a mindmap.

  <h3 class="ggallhead2">Ideation</h3>
  <div class="ggideation">
    <p>
      We approach this project by separating the requirements in growing an automated plant growing system, split it into subsystems, and assigned each member a system according to skill and interest.

    <img src="" class="ftpics5" alt="">
    
    <p>
      Challenges: This project moved remote due to COVD-19, which affected communication and teamwork since the subsystems were divided. We overcame this barrier during the assembly phase where we adjusted individual subsystems and worked together to compile the grow box.

  <h3 class="ggallhead1">Prototyping</h3>
  <div class="ftprototyping">
    <p>The semester going off-campus and online affected what testing was possible. In addition to the tests which were replaced by simulation or calculation, it had been planned to conduct a live test of the final design by planting some microgreens and herbs and monitoring their growth and health. This would be the typical use for the product and would therefore be a good demonstration of its effectiveness, while also giving the team a good idea of the real-world ease of use and convenience of the product.

    <div class=ggprototype>  User Interface Prototyping-
       Online Arduino simulation using potentiometer to detect moisture content. At 5V moisture is high and the LED will blink blue. At 0V moisture is low and the LED  will turn red. Will demonstrate user interface by allowing the user to input water or grow light cycle times using push buttons and LCD screen.

  <h3 class="ftallhead">Lesson Learned</h3>
  <div class="ftoutcome">
    <p>Grow ‘N’ Go is a project built through a collaborative effort where each member of this diverse team took a lead in a subsystem to design, simulate and assemble the grow box within a 10-week time frame. Although half of this experience consisted of online software and simulation usage, the final product was successfully assembled and met its target specifications.
      <br> The project enhanced my knowledge in electronics, coding, and sparked my interest in UX/UI design. My main role was the user interface and each member would come to me if they needed an automation technique that facilitates ease towards usage.

  <h3 class="ggallhead4">Next Steps</h3>
  <div class="ggnext">
    <p>The goal is to entice the users to invest in this product for long term usage. Currently the cost runs to approximately $553.01 dollars, so the next step would be investigating cheaper iterations. In addition, considerations in developing an app that would connect the grow box to the phone would be a beneficial aspect to examine so the user can control their grow box wherever their location is.</p>
