    The goal of this project is to address individuals specifically college students who lack physical fitness due to excessive time spent studying. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The wellness triangle contains three of the following: social, physical, and mental wellbeing for a balanced lifestyle. As observed on college campuses, students often acquire two of the three wellbeings, often lacking in physical fitness. This product described, called Foot Tapper, observes natural motion to overcome the myth of multitasking allowing students to study and exercise at the same time.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="ftblue"> 
  <h3 class="ftallhead">Final Product Overview:</h3>
  <div class="ftfinalproduct">
    <p>The Foot Tapper is made to be placed right below one’s feet while seated in a chair pursuing normal activities. The user’s feet are placed on the upper surface of the device and as they push down on it. The person using this device would repeatedly be pushing their feet down against a surface and the device held with elastics would rebound to its original position. This device mainly works the quad and thigh muscles.

    <h3 class="ftallhead">Design Process</h3>
  </div>

  <h3 class="ftallhead2">Research</h3>
  <div class="ftresearch">
    <p>We began this project by researching and developing a persona of a close family member and design to improve the lifestyle of this persona. In this case, our person is a hardworking medical student. To fully understand and empathize with the person, we laid out his interests, goals, frustrations, and background. We observed that he lacks the ability to pursue his hobbies due to the intense curriculum in medical school. 
    </p>

<!--   
  <div class="ftblue">  -->
  <h3 class="ftallhead2">Ideation</h3>
  <div class="ftideation">
    <p>
      We began our brainstorming process by observing the circumstance of the user such as spending majority of his time doing busy work such as readings that don’t require being seated
    </p>
    <li>
      Curved Skateboard-like device just without the wheels: user could twist side to side(more cardio-based)
    </li> <li>
      Miniature See-Saw: would rock side to side on to exercise their quads as well as their core and balance
   </li> <li>
      Foot-Tapping: device that allows people to step up and down in place would allow for a lower body workout (vast numbers of people naturally tap their feet due to stress)
    </li>
    <img src="images/portfolio1-ideation.jpg" class="ftpics5" alt="">
    <br>
    <p>
      Chosen Design: Since our persona struggled with time management, we placed an emphasis on user intuition and multi-tasking. The last option inherits potential multitasking capabilities with convenient placement under the student’s desk.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

  <h3 class="ftallhead2">Prototyping</h3>
  <div class="ftprototyping">
    <p>
      We created a low fidelity prototype out of cardboard to test out structure, geometry, and functionality. 
    </p>
    <img src="images/portfolio1-prototype.jpg" class="ftpics6" alt="">
    </div>
  <div class="ftprototyping2">
    <p>Prototype includes</p>
    <li>Guide:  keeps plates at rest position, even with elastic bands attached. Preventing the top plate from opening up 180 degrees</li>
    <li>Pin: molded to the side of the top plate, pin moves along a cutout in the guide to direct the movement of the top plate as the user as force acts on it </li>
    <li>Weighted boxes: placed on the bottom on the equipment to allow for height adjustment. If taken apart can act as weights</li>
    <li>Elastic bands (string in prototype): allows for rebound of equipment back to original position to allow foot tapping to occur.</li>
  </div>
<div class="ftblue2"> 
  <h3 class="ftallhead">Final Design Outcome</h3>
  <div class="ftoutcome">
    <p>The final product utilizes natural motion that is easy to implement while sitting. Incorporating this natural motion in the design of this exercise tool successfully allows students to work out their legs while studying. In addition, this design facilitates convenient placement under the desk to create an incentive to use this equipment during breaks.

  </div>
  <h3 class="ftallhead4">Next Steps</h3>
  <div class="ftnext">
    <p>Our next step would be to change the material of our device into metal. This would make it sturdier and allow the user to actually step down on it, increasing it’s breath of functionality and make it more user interactive.</p>
